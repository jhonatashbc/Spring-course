# SpringApi-RESTfull-JWT
 SPRING RESTfull API

Personal project for study purpose

Feel free to use as a help material for your studies

Download the project and import into your favorite IDE, for this project I used the Sprint tool 4

Required Mysql database instaled in your computer

About the database's name you can configure in the file application.properties and some other configurable parameters

To use and test the project, just execute it and the hibernate will create all tables in the database for you

In case you are having problems with this, go to the file application.properties and change the propertie 

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

TO

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create

and then, execute the project, after that change it back, and done, be happy :)
